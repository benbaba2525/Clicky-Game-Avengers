### Instructions

1. Create a new React application using Create React App.<br>
2. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.<br>
3. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time.<br> The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.<br>
4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.<br>
5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.<br>
6. When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
